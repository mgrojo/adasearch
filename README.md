This repository is dedicated to the Ada Search: custom Google search engine
for the Ada/SPARK programming language. It contains:

* [index.html](index.html) - Ready to deploy the HTML/JavaScript page which can
  be added to a webpage.

**INFO:** This project is no longer maintained. Feel free to clone it and take
care about it.

Main reason why this project exists is that I was tired of filtering standard
search results from information about diabetes, dentist and generally name of
Ada. List of excluded keywords growth almost with every day and don't help
too much.

Also, this project exists to help others create and maintain they own version
of custom search engine :)

The whole search engine is based on [Google Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph).
