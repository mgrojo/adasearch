This repository is dedicated to the Ada Search: custom Google search engine
for the Ada/SPARK programming language. It contains:

* [index.html](index.html) - Ready to deploy the HTML/JavaScript page which can
  be added to a webpage.

If you have any questions, problems or ideas about the Ada Search feel free to
open [ticket](https://www.laeran.pl/repositories/adasearch/tktnew). If you read
this file on Github: **please don't send pull requests here**. All will be
automatically closed. Any code propositions should go to the [Fossil](https://www.laeran.pl/repositories/adasearch)
repository.

Main reason why this project exists is that I was tired of filtering standard
search results from information about diabetes, dentist and generally name of
Ada. List of excluded keywords growth almost with every day and don't helped
too much.

Also, this project exists to help others create and maintain they own version
of custom search engine :)

The whole search engine is based on [Google Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph).
