This repository is dedicated to the Ada Search: a custom Google search engine
for the Ada/SPARK programming language, and other search engines customized for Ada. It contains:

* [index.html](index.html) - Ready to deploy the HTML/JavaScript page which can
  be added to a webpage.

The main reason why this project exists is that I was tired of filtering standard
search results from information about diabetes, dentist and generally name of
Ada. List of excluded keywords growth almost with every day and don't help
too much.

Also, this project exists to help others create and maintain their own version
of a custom search engine :)

The custom search engine is based on [Google Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph).

**INFO:** This project is a maintained fork of the now archived project thindil/adasearch.
