Here is a short list of configuration options used to create Ada Search in
[Google Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)

1. Creating a new search engine:
* Sites to search - leave empty, we want to search the whole Web
* Name of the search engine - your choice

2. Basic configuration
* Engine Description - your choice
* Keywords - `programming "programming language"` *Note: I'm not sure if it is
  needed*
* Images Search - `Off`
* SafeSeach - `On`
* Region - `All`
* Language - `English` *Note: You may set it to all languages but it is
  equivalent for setting it to English*
* Search in the whole Web - `On`
* Restrict search results by Knowledge Graph Entities. Here the whole magic is.
  Add two entries here: `Ada (programming language)` and `Spark (programming
  language)`

3. Search features
* In synonyms add `"gnat programming studio"` (with quotes) as synonym for `gps`
