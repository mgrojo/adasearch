Here is a short list of configuration options used to create Ada Search in
[Google Custom Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)

1. Creating a new search engine:
* Sites to search - leave empty, we want to search the whole Web
* Name of the search engine - your choice

2. Basic configuration
* Engine Description - your choice
* Keywords - *programming* *"programming language"*
* Images Search - *Off*
* SafeSeach - *On*
* Region - *All*
* Language - *English*
* Search in the whole Web - *On*
* Restrict search results by Knowledge Graph Entities. Here the whole magic is.
  Add two entries here: *Ada (programming language)* and *Spark (programming
  language)*

3. Search features
* In synonyms add *"gnat programming studio"* (with quotes) as synonym for *gps*
